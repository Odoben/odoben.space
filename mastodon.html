<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Mastodon?</h2>
<p id="blueThing" class="post">
  Mastodon is a microblogging social media platform similar to Twitter but with a few key differences. Instead of being owned and operated by a single company, Mastodon is a collection of servers that are run independently from each other, operated by volunteering members of the community. It's an open platform with no algorithms, no ads and no corporate ownership.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Joining Mastodon</h2>
<p id="blueThing" class="post">
  Mastodon works a little like email in the sense that you need to choose a server to register an account on, but once you've joined, you can see, follow and interact with any user regardless of what server they are on. </p>
